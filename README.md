# FromSoft Mod Language Patcher by Nordgaren
This is a tool that patches the languages for FromSoft mods.  
It uses SoulsFormats by JK Anderson  

## Current know compatability: 
* Dark Souls: Prepare To Die Edition
* Dark Souls: Remastered
* Dark Souls III

If you would like to help me test any other FromSoft game that isn't on the list, please contact me through GitHub

### Instructions

Drag EXE and ref into English folder of the game you are trying to patch.
If you'd like to update existing entries, add the VANILLA English folder of your game to the ref folder (I.E. ref/ENGLISH for DS1 and ref/engus for DS3)  
Run the EXE. 
If you run without the reference, any entries that were null and changed will be updated, but any entries that were previously used (I.E existing items) will not.  
I would recommend restoring backups if you made a spelling error and corrected it after using this tool.
