It uses SoulsFormats by JK Anderson

### Instructions

Drag EXE into English folder of the game you are trying to patch and run the EXE. Hit yes.
If you fixed any spelling errors in your English language files AFTER you've patched the other languages, restore the other langauge files back to vanilla before running this again.
